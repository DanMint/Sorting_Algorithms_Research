# Sorting Algorithms Research

## <ins>Inspiration<ins>
In this repository I wanted to conduct reserach into sorting algorithms and thier respective time complexities. Namely, I wanted to see and test if thier given time complexities are true and why do these time complexities matter (We always learn the theory side and the break down of time complexities however I wanted to see it for my self). This research project was inspired by my masters class at Northeastern EECE 7205 and many years of algorithms practice.

## <ins>Interesting Insight<ins>

It is very interesting how diffrent algorithms act with diffrent inputs.Eventhough, the diffrence between the sorting algorithms is always evidenet the diffrence becomes much clearer with larger inputs. An interesting fact that I have observed that similar execution algorithms typicaly have the smame line in the graph further proving the correctness of thier time complexity. Below I have listed two exampels:
