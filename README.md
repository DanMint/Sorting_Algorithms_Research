# Sorting_Algorithms_Research

## Inspiration
In this repository I wanted to conduct reserach into sorting algorithms and thier time complexities. Namely, I wanted to see and test if thier given time complexities are true and why do these time complexities matter (We always learn the theory side and the break down of time complexities however I wanted to see it for my self). This research project was inspired by my masters class EECE 7205 and many years of algorithms practice.
