# Sorting_Algorithms_Research

## Inspiration
In this repository I wanted to conduct reserach into sorting algorithms and thier time complexities. Namely, I wanted to see and test if thier given time complexities are true. This research project was inspired by my masters class EECE 7205 and many years of algorithms practice.
